# Soundaze
As part of  one of our courses,  me (@[SamirM-BE](https://github.com/SamirM-BE "SamirM-BE")) and @[Djafa](https://github.com/Djafa "Djafa") we created an android application allowing to modify, process and convert audio files being on a smartphone and we also added the possibility of recording audio.

## Motivation : 

In the age of mobility and portability, people working in multimedia now tend to use mobile tools and their smartphones more often to work on-the-go: indeed, in the field, it is not always possible to have a laptop to make the necessary modifications and conversions: SOUNDAZE is there to alleviate this problem, especially with regard to audio files.
